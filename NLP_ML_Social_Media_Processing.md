# Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning for Social Media Hate-speech Analysis

[Damir Cavar](http://damir.cavar.me/) at the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/)


In the tutorial for this Hackathon and Datathon we will mostly work with a [PyTorch]-based environment for Natural Language Processing called [spaCy], using [Python 3.10.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (not any of the 3.11 versions yet due to lack of compatibility!) and Visual Studio Code.

I provide [Jupyter] notebooks with tutorials and instructions related to text preprocessing and linguistic analysis, qualitative and quantitative methods in NLP at this GitHub repo:

[Python Tutorials for NLP, ML, AI](https://github.com/dcavar/python-tutorial-notebooks)

This tutorial in preparation for the Hackathon will introduce you to:

- Text pre-processing
- Linguistic processing (or Natural Language Processing) focusing on English
- Text classification, sentiment analysis, emotion detection using social media messages
- Development of neural models (transformers, graph neural networks) for semantic processing of text

Links and other information material will be provided here ASAP.
