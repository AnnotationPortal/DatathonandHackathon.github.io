# Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning for Social Media Hate-speech Analysis

[Damir Cavar](http://damir.cavar.me/) at the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/) at [Indiana University at Bloomington].


In the tutorial for this Hackathon and Datathon we will mostly work with a [PyTorch]-based environment for Natural Language Processing called [spaCy], using [Python 3.10.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (not any of the 3.11 versions yet due to lack of compatibility!) and Visual Studio Code.

I provide [Jupyter] notebooks with tutorials and instructions related to text preprocessing and linguistic analysis, qualitative and quantitative methods in NLP at this GitHub repo:

[Python Tutorials for NLP, ML, AI](https://github.com/dcavar/python-tutorial-notebooks)

This tutorial in preparation for the Hackathon will introduce you to:

- Text pre-processing
- Linguistic processing (or Natural Language Processing) focusing on English
- Text classification, sentiment analysis, emotion detection using social media messages
- Development of neural models (transformers, graph neural networks) for semantic processing of text

Links and other information material will be provided here ASAP.



## Previous Code and Data

In 2020 we organized a Hackathon and Datathon at Indiana University in Bloomington on antisemitism in social media. The information and resources can be found here:

[Antisemitism Datathon 2020](https://github.com/dcavar/AntisemitismDatathon2020)


## Data Sets and Formats

The data and corpus will be provided to you in a specific CSV format. We will also provide a CoNLL formated version of the data. These are formats that the different Machine Learning libraries for NLP mentioned above can read.

You might want to have a look at the different corpus or linguistic data formats:

- [CoNLL-X](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W06-2920.pdf)
- [CoNLL-U](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html)
- [spaCy JSON](https://spacy.io/usage/training)
