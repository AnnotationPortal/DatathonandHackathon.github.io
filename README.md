# Datathon and Machine Learning Competition on Antisemitism

The Datathon and Machine Learning Competition will take place in July 2024. General information can be found here: 
https://isca.indiana.edu/publication-research/social-media-project/datathon-2024/index.html

## DATATHON PART OF THE COMPETITION (PART I, July 21 to August 11, 2024)

Please use our Annotation Portal at https://datathon.annotationportal.com. The functionality of the portal will be explained at the workshop on July 21. You do not need to register in advance.

We count the number of tweets that your group has correctly annotated (according to expert annotators who have previously annotated the same samples) per number of group members. The portal will automatically save your annotations. IMPORTANT: Please make sure you register to the portal with the same email address you used to register for this challenge. Please use "Antisemitism" for "Annotation Type" when registering. You can annotate all the samples provided in the class "Antisemitism". You can see how you have annotated the dataset by using the "Export" button in the portal. We will count all annotations until August 28, 2024. In addition to increasing your points for the Datathon portion, the annotation process will help you familiarize yourself with the content. 

## MACHINE LEARNING PART OF THE COMPETITION (PART II, July 28 to August 11, 2024)

More information and the labeled dataset will be provided at the workshop on July 28.

### Machine Learning Models

You will receive a labeled dataset. It contains messages from the social media platform X/Twitter with the keywords "Jews, Israel, Kikes, or Zionazi*" classified as biased/non-biased (based on 100% agreement between two annotators).

You provide the deliverables in the form of software packages with instructions on how to run them (read-me files). The software must run on any system (Unix or Windows).

The evaluation comittee will perform independent evaluations of performance on withheld data, not previously seen by the teams.

The performance measure for the classifiers will be measured as F1 scores.

You can share the files with us in any way you want. The easiest for you is probably uploading it to any cloud storage and sharing the link with us.
