## DATATHON PART OF THE COMPETITION (PART I, January 23 to February 19, 2023)

Please use our Annotation Portal at https://workshop.annotationportal.com/

We will count the number of tweets that your group has annotated correctly (according to expert annotators who labeled the same samples previously) per number of group members. The Portal saves your annotation automatically. Make sure that you register to the Portal with the same email address that you used to register for this competition. You can see how you labeled the dataset by using the "Export" button of the Portal. We will count all annotations until February 19, 2023. You can use any or all of the different annotation types that you see on the Portal, according to your competencies and preferences. In addition to increasing your points for the Datathon part, the annotation process will also help you to familiarize yourself with the content. The labeled datasets that you will receive for the Hackathon part of the competition come from the same samples.

## HACKATHON PART OF THE COMPETITION (PART II, January 30 to February 19, 2023)

More information and the labeled dataset will be provided at the workshop on January 29

### Machine Learning Models

Teams will receive training and evaluation data.
The data includes two labeled datasets of tweets
-	Messages with the keywords Asians, Blacks, Jews, Latinos, or Muslims classified as biased/non-biased and Calling Out biased/ not Calling Out biased (based on 75% of annotators’ agreement)
-	Messages with the keywords “Jews, Israel, Kikes, or Zionazi*” classified as biased/non-biased and Calling Out biased/ not Calling Out biased (based on 100% of two annotators’ agreement)

Teams will conduct independent evaluations with the objective of characterizing the quality, functionality, and performance of the solution to classify tweets and social media messages along two binary variables for the two datasets (separately and together).

-	Bias
-	Calling Out
-	Both

Teams provide deliverables as:

-	Software packages with instructions on how to run them (Read Me files)
-	Software has to be runnable on any Linux or Windows system

The project management team will perform independent evaluations of performance on held-out data, not previously seen by teams.

The performance measure for the classifiers will be measured as F1 scores.


### Data Annotation Evaluation
Will be provided after a non-disclosure agreement has been signed.
