## Prerequisites

Some of the notebooks require that you have a file `secret.py` in the same folder as the notebook. In this folder you will find the file `secret_template.py`. Rename this file to `secret.py` and fill in the API keys for the different platforms. This requires you to register with the platforms and potentially to make a downpayment for the use of the models.
